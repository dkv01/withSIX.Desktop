You are responsible for paying all fees associated with your use of the GeoIP Databases. Unless MaxMind implements special billing arrangements for your account, payment for all services is due in advance.

SPECIAL BILLING ARRANGEMENTS FOR WEB SERVICES.

In some circumstances in which customers have reached or agreed to a certain consistent level of monthly service usage for web services, MaxMind may extend special billing arrangements allowing the customer to pay for the web service in arrears (i.e., retroactively) on a monthly or quarterly basis.

If MaxMind chooses to extend a special billing arrangement to you, which decision shall be made in MaxMind's sole discretion, MaxMind shall provide you with written notice of the extension of special billing arrangements along with the billing arrangement payment schedule. If any fee payment is not received by MaxMind within five (5) business days of the due date, you shall be obligated to pay late charges on the unpaid amount from the due date in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) one percent (1%) per month, or (ii) the maximum amount permitted by applicable law, calculated on a daily basis. If you fail to make fee payments in accordance with the special billing arrangement, you shall pay to MaxMind all of MaxMind's costs and expenses, including legal costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by MaxMind in collecting any fee payments due.

APPLICATION PROGRAM INTERFACES (APIs)

Upon your request, MaxMind may facilitate your access to certain application program interfaces ("APIs") for use with the GeoIP Databases, minFraud Service, and other MaxMind products. Some APIs may have been developed by third parties. MaxMind and you acknowledge that the APIs are not GeoIP Databases or other MaxMind products as defined in this Agreement and that MaxMind does not provide any warranties for the APIs. Any copying, implementation, or other use of any APIs provided to you by MaxMind is subject to the license terms distributed with such APIs or their associated software or documentation.

You may immediately terminate this Agreement upon written notice to MaxMind if a change is unacceptable to you. Your continued use of the GeoIP Data and GeoIP Databases following notice to you of a change shall constitute your acceptance of the change.

NO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES/LIMITATION ON LIABILITY.
